# Genetic-Algo
The purpose of this code was to design a genetic algorithm in a cleaners game. The goal of the game is for my agent to clean more dirt than the random agent in a 41x41 grid. There are 80 cleaners in total (40 - my agent)(40 - random agent). I successfully designed a genetic algorithm that improves the average fitness of the cleaners over a specified amount of generations.
